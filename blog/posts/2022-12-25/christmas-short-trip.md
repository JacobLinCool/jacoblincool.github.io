description: I got a free HSR ticket!

Today is Christmas.

It was a few days before Christmas, and my classmates at the Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering were getting excited about the holiday and the 2-month long winter vacation. One of my classmates had decided to throw a Christmas party to celebrate the occasion, and some of us were invited.

That day, after the last exam, we all went to the party. We exchanged gifts, ate some delicious food, and played some games. It was a lot of fun, and we all had a great time.

I got a new beanie and a pair of gloves from one of my classmates. And I got an HSR round-trip ticket (`Taipei <-> Nangang`) from another classmate. I was very happy, and I thanked them for the gifts.

So, today, I decided to go on a short trip with my family to Nangang. Thanks to the free HSR ticket, this Christmas is going to be a lot more fun.
